This interactive app leverages powerful language models and tools to solve math-related questions and provide useful data search results from Wikipedia.

# üåü What does this app do?

Math Problem Solving: You can ask math-related questions, and the app will provide detailed solutions along with step-by-step explanations.
Data Search via Wikipedia: The app can also search Wikipedia for relevant information based on your query. It's like having a personal assistant that can both solve math problems and help you gather knowledge from the web.

# üöÄ How does it work?
The app integrates several powerful tools from LangChain and Google's Gemma model to process and answer questions intelligently.

GROQ API Key: The app uses Google's Gemma2-9B-It model via the GROQ API for reasoning and mathematical problem-solving. To get started, you'll need to provide your API key in the sidebar.

Math Solver: Using LangChain's LLMMathChain, the app can evaluate mathematical expressions and show you a detailed solution.

Wikipedia Search: Need background information? The app also integrates with the Wikipedia API to search for relevant data on any topic.

Interactive Chat: After typing in your question, the assistant will respond in a conversation-like format, providing answers, explanations, and any extra information you might need.

# üìù How to Use the App?

Enter Your Question:

Type your question in the input box. Whether it's a math problem or something you'd like to learn more about, you can ask away! For example:

"How many apples are left if I gave away 2 out of 10?"

"What is the history of calculus?"

Generate Your Answer:

Once you hit the "Find My Answer" button, the assistant will process your request using multiple tools:

For math questions, it will break down the solution and explain it point-by-point.

For general knowledge, it will fetch data from Wikipedia.

Receive Responses:

After a brief wait, the assistant will respond to your query with a detailed explanation and solution. The chat history will update so you can keep track of the conversation.

Interactive Experience:

You can continue asking questions or clarifications, and the assistant will keep the conversation going smoothly.

# ü§î What kind of questions can you ask?

Math Problems:

Any math question, from basic arithmetic to more advanced topics like algebra, calculus, and geometry. Example: "What is 5 + 3?" or "Solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0."

# General Knowledge & Wikipedia Search:

Ask anything about science, history, technology, or any topic. Example: "Tell me about the theory of relativity," or "What is the capital of Japan?"

# Reasoning and Logic Questions:

Need help with logical puzzles or reasoning questions? This app can help you break them down step by step.

# üí° Features to Explore:

Step-by-step Math Solutions

For every math problem, you‚Äôll get a detailed solution process, so you can learn how the answer is derived.

# Wikipedia-powered Search

The app can search Wikipedia for information on any topic, helping you find explanations and summaries quickly.

# Interactive Chat Interface

A conversational interface where you can continuously ask questions and get responses.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Behind the App:

LangChain: A framework for building language model-powered applications, which we‚Äôve used to handle math and logic questions.
GROQ API: Powered by Google's Gemma2-9B-It model, this API helps with reasoning and solving complex queries.
Wikipedia API: For fetching data from Wikipedia based on your queries.

# üö® Important Notes:

Make sure to input your GROQ API key in the sidebar before using the app, as it‚Äôs required for the backend processing.
If you have any trouble or need further assistance, feel free to ask the assistant directly!
